# Image Tampering Detection - README

## Project Overview
The **Image Tampering Detection** project is designed to detect any tampering in an image, such as cloning or splicing, by leveraging deep learning models. The project uses **EfficientNet**, **VGG19**, and **DenseNet201** for image feature extraction, and it is built using a Flask web application to provide a user-friendly interface.

### Features:
- Detects tampered or altered images.
- Utilizes deep learning models for accurate detection.
- Offers a web-based interface for uploading and testing images.
- Provides visual feedback on the tampered regions in the image.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

### Python Libraries:

- **efficientnet**: A library for EfficientNet models.
  ```
  pip install -U efficientnet
  ```
- **OpenCV**: Library for image and video processing.
  ```
  pip install opencv-python
  ```
- **NumPy**: A library for handling arrays and matrices.
  ```
  pip install numpy
  ```
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  ```
  pip install pandas
  ```
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
  ```
  pip install seaborn
  ```
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting library for creating graphs and visualizations.
  ```
  pip install matplotlib
  ```
- **Keras**: For building and training deep learning models.
  ```
  pip install keras
  ```
- **TensorFlow**: Backend for Keras to run deep learning models.
  ```
  pip install tensorflow
  ```
- **Flask**: A micro-framework for building web applications.
  ```
  pip install flask
  ```

### Additional Libraries:
- **PIL** (Pillow): Python Imaging Library for handling images.
  ```
  pip install pillow
  ```
- **tqdm**: A progress bar for Python loops.
  ```
  pip install tqdm
  ```

  ```
  pip install scikit-learn
  ```

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd image-tampering-detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Install all the required Python libraries listed above by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the Flask Application**:
   Run the Flask server to launch the web interface.
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Web Application**:
   Open a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to use the image tampering detection interface.

## Usage

- Upload an image through the web interface.
- The model will analyze the image and display a result indicating whether the image is tampered or original.
- The interface also provides feedback on the regions suspected of being tampered.

## Models Used

1. **EfficientNet**: Used for image classification tasks, providing a balance between model size and accuracy.
2. **VGG19**: A pre-trained deep learning model used for feature extraction.
3. **DenseNet201**: Another pre-trained model known for its performance in image recognition tasks.

## Example

1. Upload an image (e.g., `example.jpg`).
2. The system processes the image and displays:
   - The result (Original or Tampered).
   - Any suspected tampered regions in the image.

## License
This project is open-source and free to use.
